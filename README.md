## The co- and post-seismic slip models of the 2020 Mw 6.3 Yutian earthquake derived from InSAR observations

The co-seismic slip distribution model is stored in the file "2020yutianEQ_coseismic_slip_model.simp", and the post-seismic afterslip distribution model is stored in the file "2020yutianEQ_afterslip_model.simp".
 
The data format is ".simp", The records in each row represent a sub-fault patch.
